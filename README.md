# CP341
Team Members: Kalie Chang, Grace Mun, Willa Polman

Expectations:

We expect to work about 5 hours after class. We will likely break for one hour during lunchtime and continue working until about 6pm. We will communicate via text (all three of us have a group chat and we will likely have our phones with us at all times so we can be incredibly responsive).

Directories:

We will have a main directory, which has our most current working code. We will only push from the branches into the main directory if we know that the code 100% works.

We will also have multiple branches that contain our experimental code. For example, if our goal is to create code that makes the LED lights blink, then we should have a branch labeled something like "LEDLights" that contains our working code.

Branching/Merging:

Since we are working towards building a network, we should approach this large task in components. Each component that we are actively working on will have its own separate branch (EX: led lights). When we are completed working on that component, we will merge it back to the main branch and continue building up the code in our main branch until we develop a working network system. If there are merge conflicts, then we handle them carefully by fusing the two files together and deleting/adjusting the portions of code that was altered so that we can have a working new code file (as done in CP274, Software Design).
